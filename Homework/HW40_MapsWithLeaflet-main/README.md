# Creating Maps with Leaflet

Leaflet is a popular library for creating interactive maps. The StartWithLeaflet.R shows how you can create interactive maps with simple and more layered backgrounds and then bring in and display data you have created in GoogleSheets and display it. 

Leaflet has excellent documentation at https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/
