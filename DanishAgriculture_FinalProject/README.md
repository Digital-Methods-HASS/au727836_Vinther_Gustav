## About the project
In this project, we want to use data to provide input on some relevant questions about the state and development of agriculture in Denmark. We plan to achieve this by making visualizations in R with data from Danmarks Statistik. We want to look at a current picture of Danish agriculture and put it in a historical perspective, where we want to provide an input into the debate about whether Denmark can be classified as an agricultural country, as it has been historically. We also want to touch upon the current debate about the emissions from agriculture and to see how the origins of the debate can be seen through data.

## Data Acquisition and Processing
Our project is based on data from Statistics Denmark. Through our process of acquiring data, we have chosen specific datasets that would be relevant to showcase the status of Danish agriculture today, as well as historically. Data from Statistics Denmark operates with the Creative Commons, CC 4.0 BY license.

Our raw data have tidied in excel and converted to csv. files.

## Software
We’ve written the code for this project on a MacBook Air M2, 2022, 8 GB RAM running macOS Sonoma 14.0. We worked in the desktop version of RStudio (Version 2023.09.0+463)
